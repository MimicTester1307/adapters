### QUESTION
How far away is the Moon from the Earth?

### ANSWER
The Moon is about 239,000 miles (384,000 kilometers) away from the Earth.

### EXPLANATION
The Moon is a rocky, gaseous body that orbits the Earth. It is about one-quarter the size of the Earth and is separated from the Earth by about 239,000 miles (384,000 kilometers) of space.

### RELATED TERMS
Moon, Earth, orbit, distance, space.

### INTERESTING FACTS
The Moon is the fifth largest moon in the solar system and is the only moon in the solar system that is visible from Earth without the aid of a telescope. The Moon is also the source of the Earth's tides, as its gravitational pull causes the oceans to bulge outward.

##### CONTEXT
The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter. Its gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens Earth's day. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. However, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through cyclical shifts in perspective known as libration.

### QUESTION
At what distance does the Moon orbit the Earth?

### ANSWER
The Moon orbits the Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi).

### EXPLANATION
The passage provides information about the distance of the Moon's orbit from Earth, stating that it is about 384,400 km (238,900 mi) away on average. This is the main driver of Earth's tides and slowly lengthens Earth's day.
